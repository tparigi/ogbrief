Good morning and welcome to your Oil and Gas Daily Briefing for Saturday, January 31st, 2026. I'm Cam, and let's dive into today's top stories.

We're closing out January with a bang for the oil majors. ExxonMobil shares are up 15 percent this month — their best January performance since October 2022. Chevron isn't far behind at 14 percent. The rally is being driven by rising crude prices, geopolitical tensions, and strong fundamentals. Both companies just reported all-time record production in the fourth quarter, with Exxon hitting a 40-year high at 4.7 million barrels per day.

Speaking of Exxon and Chevron — both are taking a cautious wait-and-see approach on Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods says they have the technology to extract Venezuelan heavy crude at lower cost, but need to see a democratic transition before committing new investment. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth says they could ramp up Venezuelan production by 50 percent over two years — but only under the right conditions. For now, no new spending from either company.

Up in Alaska, the cleanup of the Doyon Rig 26 — affectionately known as "The Beast" — has entered a critical phase. The massive 9.5-million-pound rig, the largest mobile land drilling rig in North America, toppled over last week. About 4,000 gallons of diesel and 600 gallons of hydraulic oil were absorbed by snow-covered tundra less than 500 feet from a tributary to the Colville River. Eight workers were treated for minor injuries. ConocoPhillips says they expect no material impact to production — they've identified a substitute rig and all four planned exploration wells remain on track.

Major news from Canada today. Imperial Oil announced it will shut down operations at Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories — ending over a century of oil production there. Production is slated to end in the third quarter of this year as the facility reaches the end of its lifespan. The closure was driven by declining production and low oil prices hovering around 60 dollars per barrel. Final reclamation work won't begin until after 2030.

On the regulatory front, Enbridge and the State of Michigan have agreed to let federal courts take the lead in deciding the fate of the Line 5 pipeline dispute. A Supreme Court hearing on whether the case belongs in state or federal courts is scheduled for next month. For now, a federal judge's decision ensures Line 5 can keep moving oil and natural gas liquids while the litigation plays out.

And in Washington, President Trump signed an executive order threatening tariffs on any country selling oil to Cuba, declaring a national security emergency. The move primarily targets Mexico, which has been sending fuel shipments to the island. This comes as the Supreme Court may soon rule on the administration's use of emergency powers for tariffs.

Finally, some market notes: U.S. drilling activity continues its decline with the Permian Basin rig count now at 242 — down 61 from year-ago levels. Occidental Petroleum shares have rallied over 10 percent year-to-date. And the U.S. now supplies 60 percent of Europe's LNG imports, cementing its role as the dominant supplier.

That's your briefing for today. Eight companies featured: ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Imperial Oil, Enbridge, Occidental, Hess, and Doyon Drilling. Have a great weekend, and I'll see you on Monday.
