Good morning! This is your Oil and Gas Daily Briefing for Thursday, January 29th, 2026.

We're leading with breaking news: Carlyle Group has agreed to acquire most of Lukoil's international assets in a deal valued at approximately 22 billion dollars. Russia's second-largest oil producer is being forced to divest under U.S. sanctions imposed just three months ago. The deal includes stakes in Kazakhstan's massive Karachaganak and Tengiz fields, plus a 12.5% share of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. The transaction is pending regulatory approval.

Meanwhile, Chevron continues negotiating with Iraq over the giant West Qurna 2 oilfield. The American supermajor is pushing for improved profit-sharing terms before taking over Lukoil's 75% stake. This field alone accounts for about half a percent of global oil supply and nearly 10% of Iraq's production. Lukoil has until February 28th to complete the divestiture.

Now to the extraordinary natural gas market moves. Henry Hub spot prices smashed all-time records, surging to 30 dollars and 56 cents per million BTU on Monday. Futures jumped more than 119% over five days — the largest increase since 1990. Home heating prices have soared to their highest levels since 2022.

In a highly unusual development, BP and Shell imported LNG cargoes INTO the United States from Trinidad during the freeze. Export terminals at Elba Island and Cove Point received these imports — facilities that normally send gas OUT to the rest of the world. With prices exceeding 100 dollars per million BTU in some regions, it simply made economic sense to bring in cargoes.

On the Venezuela front, Washington is preparing to issue a general license lifting some sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry following Maduro's removal. President Trump is demanding Venezuela supply 50 million barrels of crude to the United States. Citgo has already bought Venezuelan oil for the first time since 2019.

ExxonMobil continues its carbon capture buildout on the Gulf Coast. The company plans to start up three more CCS projects in Louisiana this year. Louisiana's leadership in carbon capture has attracted 76 billion dollars in potential new investments. In related news, Exxon and China's BYD signed a new strategic memorandum to expand their hybrid electric vehicle partnership, focusing on joint R&D for plug-in hybrid technology.

In Alaska, ConocoPhillips executives addressed the destruction of Doyon Rig 26 — nicknamed "The Beast" — calling it a "sad day" but emphasizing minimal operational impact. A federal judge ruled the company can proceed with its winter drilling program. ConocoPhillips has identified a substitute rig and plans to drill four new wells this winter. The Willow project expansion continues on schedule.

On the regulatory front, the USDA Forest Service has finalized revisions to federal oil and gas leasing regulations for National Forest lands. The updated rule streamlines compliance monitoring as part of the administration's National Energy Emergency orders.

And finally, Enbridge is being highlighted as a top dividend pick for 2026. The pipeline giant moves 20% of U.S. natural gas and 30% of North American crude production. The stock has returned an impressive 1,700% to shareholders since 2001.
