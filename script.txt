Good morning, this is your Oil and Gas Daily Briefing for Wednesday, January 28th, 2026.

Leading our coverage today: U.S. oil production is bouncing back after Winter Storm Fern knocked out nearly 2 million barrels per day over the weekend — that's roughly 15 percent of total American output. The Permian Basin took the hardest hit, but operators report rapid recovery underway. ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Occidental, and Chevron all saw freeze-related disruptions. Oil prices settled 3 percent higher Tuesday, while natural gas surged to 6 dollars per million BTU — the highest since late 2022.

In safety news, the situation on Alaska's North Slope remains tense. Doyon Rig 26 — nicknamed "The Beast" and one of the largest mobile drilling rigs in North America — is still too unstable for responders to access after it toppled Friday near the village of Nuiqsut. Eight workers were treated and released with no serious injuries. ConocoPhillips says it's mobilizing a replacement rig and will continue its Willow project drilling on schedule.

ExxonMobil is accelerating its carbon capture push along the Gulf Coast. The company plans to start capturing 3 million metric tons of CO2 annually from industrial partners Nucor and Linde in the second half of this year. Total contracted CCS volume now sits at 9 million tons per year across six customers. Notably, Exxon is also eyeing a final investment decision by late 2026 on its first Low Carbon Data Center — pairing natural gas power with carbon capture to serve the explosive growth in data center demand.

On the international front, Chevron is negotiating hard with Iraq over improved contract terms before committing to acquire West Qurna 2 from sanctioned Russian company Lukoil. The field represents about half a percent of global oil supply. Separately, Canada and India held their first ministerial energy dialogue in eight years, with Canada pitching itself as a reliable LNG, crude, and uranium supplier to diversify its near-total dependence on U.S. exports.

In corporate news, Cenovus has completed its MEG Energy takeover and set an aggressive 2026 capital budget of up to 5.3 billion dollars. And on the regulatory side, the Trump administration is inviting the oil industry to nominate areas for offshore leases in Southern and Central California, with the first sales penciled in for 2027.

That's your briefing. Twelve companies in today's news: ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Occidental, Cenovus, Suncor, Enbridge, Doyon Drilling, Lukoil, CF Industries, Nucor, and Linde. Full details and source links at the briefing page. See you tomorrow.
