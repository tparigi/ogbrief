Good morning, this is your Oil and Gas Daily Briefing for Friday, January 30th, 2026.

It's earnings day for Big Oil, and the numbers are in. ExxonMobil beat Wall Street estimates this morning, reporting adjusted earnings of a dollar seventy-one per share versus expectations of a dollar sixty-eight. The real headline here? Production. Exxon hit its highest full-year output in over forty years — 4.7 million barrels per day. Their Permian Basin and Guyana operations continue to fire on all cylinders.

But when it comes to Venezuela, CEO Darren Woods isn't mincing words. He told President Trump the country is, quote, "uninvestable" — though Exxon will send a technical team to assess the situation.

Chevron also beat expectations, with adjusted earnings of a dollar fifty-two versus a dollar forty-five expected. More importantly, they posted record production at just over 4 million barrels per day — up 21 percent from last year. And unlike Exxon, Chevron is bullish on Venezuela. CEO Mike Wirth says they can ramp up production there by 50 percent over the next 18 to 24 months if conditions are right. The company also bumped its quarterly dividend by 4 percent.

Speaking of Venezuela — history was made yesterday. Acting President Delcy Rodriguez signed a sweeping reform that opens Venezuela's oil sector to privatization, ending PDVSA's monopoly. This reverses over two decades of socialist energy policy. Private companies can now take full operational control, and perhaps most importantly, disputes can now go to independent arbitration — not Venezuelan courts. That's a game-changer for attracting skittish international majors.

On the M&A front, Reuters reports that Devon Energy and Coterra Energy could announce a merger as soon as next week. This would be the largest shale deal in almost two years. Both companies have significant operations in the Permian and Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin. Expect this to be billed as a merger of equals.

Up in Alaska, ConocoPhillips says the spectacular failure of Doyon Rig 26 — affectionately known as "The Beast" — won't derail their winter drilling program. The ten-million-pound rig tipped over and caught fire during transport last Friday. Eight workers were treated for minor injuries. But ConocoPhillips already identified a substitute rig, and all four planned exploration wells remain on track. A federal judge also denied environmental groups' request to halt drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve.

In Canada, Suncor is riding high after achieving its Investor Day targets a full year ahead of schedule. Analysts see them as well-positioned to benefit from heavy oil demand shifts following Venezuela's political changes. Meanwhile, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and BC Premier David Eby have found common ground on Trans Mountain expansion, with Smith planning to unveil a proposal for an entirely new pipeline in June.

On the technology front, AI's insatiable appetite for power is reshaping the energy landscape. U.S. gas power projects tripled in 2025, driven by datacenter demand. Microsoft has even admitted they're open to natural gas with carbon capture to keep their data centers running. The AI-in-energy market is projected to hit over 18 billion dollars by 2030.

And finally, some quick analyst notes: Morgan Stanley cut EOG Resources' price target to 128 dollars, citing soft cash flow despite strong operations. And Permian Basin production is expected to stay flat around 6.6 million barrels per day through 2026.
